# AI-Powered Portfolio Website

Welcome to my AI-Powered Portfolio Website! This project is a modern, responsive portfolio built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript as part of the #30days30projects challenge. It features a sleek design with sections for Home, About, Projects, and Contact, along with a dark theme toggle, smooth scrolling navigation, and interactive project cards with hover effects. The highlight is an AI-powered chatbot integrated with the Gemini API, offering a dynamic and interactive user experience.

## Key Features
